## Cashonize: a Bitcoin Cash Wallet

**Cashonize is an easy-to-use, multi-platfrom Bitcoin Cash wallet** <br>
Cashonize supports CashTokens and WalletConnect which makes it an ideal wallet for using dapps on BCH. <br>
Currently Cashonize is available as webwallet and a desktop application. <br>


### The wallet for you?

Because of its minimalist design, Cashonize is a user-friendly wallet, even for inexperienced users.
Cashonize nicely displays your NFT collections by collapsing NFTs of the same tokenId, making it ideal for NFT collectors.

Cashonize is a single-address wallet, for privacy-centered users is better to use a HD-wallet.
Cashonize does not have a display for your transaction history and for now it only supports USD for denomating BCH balances.
